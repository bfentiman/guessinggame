Think of an animal

This was a game that I played on a computer at the Science Museum in London, when I was about 10.
I was inspired by this game, and it was one of the many things that teased me into a career in computing.

Here are a few different versions, with different data structures and code layouts, 
which might be of use to teachers introducing Python to children in their classes.
